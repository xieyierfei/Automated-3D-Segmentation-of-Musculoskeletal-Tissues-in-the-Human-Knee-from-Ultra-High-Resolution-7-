# Automated-3D-Segmentation-of-Musculoskeletal-Tissues-in-the-Human-Knee-from-Ultra-High-Resolution-7-
Use transfer learning to create a deep-learning network for automatic segmentation of ultra-high resolution 3D 7T MRI knee cartilage images using only a small number of ultra-high resolution 7T images for transfer learning and a large number of lower-resolution 3T images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database for initial network training.
This is the low-resolution network. Low-resolution network and high-resolution network constitute transfer learning network.
